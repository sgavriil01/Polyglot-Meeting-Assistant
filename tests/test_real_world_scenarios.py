    Chairman Robert: Welcome everyone to our quarterly board meeting. We have several critical decisions to make today regarding our expansion strategy.
    
    CFO Maria: Thank you Robert. I've prepared the financial projections. We need to decide on the proposed $2.5 million investment in our European expansion.
    
    CEO Jennifer: Based on market analysis, I believe we should approve this investment. Maria, can you walk us through the ROI calculations by next Monday?
    
    Maria: Certainly. I will prepare a comprehensive ROI analysis with 3-year projections by Monday morning.

    Chairman Robert: Lisa, can you investigate the delays and report back by Wednesday?
    
    Lisa: I'll audit the vendor contracts and identify bottlenecks. Maria, you should coordinate with IT procurement on this.
    
    Maria: Agreed. I'll schedule meetings with all stakeholders by end of this week.
    
    CEO Jennifer: Final decision - we will proceed with the European expansion pending David's committee review.
    
    Chairman Robert: The board unanimously agreed to implement the new governance framework starting January 2026.
    
    David: The implementation timeline will be approximately 6-8 months from board approval.
