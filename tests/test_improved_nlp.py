    Sarah: Good morning everyone. Today we need to make some critical decisions about our Q4 strategy.
    
    Michael: Thanks Sarah. I've reviewed the budget proposals and I think we need to decide on three key areas.
    
    Sarah: Michael, can you walk us through the budget breakdown by Thursday? 
    
    Michael: Absolutely. I will prepare a detailed analysis by Thursday morning.
    
    Lisa: We have decided to approve the new marketing campaign with a budget of $50,000.
    
    Tom: Great! Lisa, will you coordinate with the design team on this?
    
    Lisa: Yes, I'll reach out to them today. Tom, you should contact the vendors by Friday.
    
    Sarah: Everyone agreed that we're moving forward with the hybrid work model starting January 1st.
    
    Michael: The timeline for implementation will be approximately 6 weeks from approval.
    
    Lisa: I need to survey all department heads by next week to get their input.
    
    Tom: We voted to reject the proposal for the new office space downtown.
    
    Sarah: Final decision - we will invest in the employee training program instead.
    
    Michael: The training should be completed within the next 3 months.
    
    Lisa: Tom and I will develop the curriculum by December 15th.
    
    Sarah: Perfect. Michael, can you calculate the total cost impact?
    
    Michael: I'll have those numbers ready by end of week.
    
    Tom: We concluded that the project timeline needs to be 2-3 weeks longer than originally planned.
    
    Lisa: Also, we approved the Q1 hiring plan with 5 new positions.
    
    Sarah: Meeting adjourned. Thanks everyone for your input.
