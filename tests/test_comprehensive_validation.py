    CEO Sarah Mitchell: Good morning everyone. We're facing some critical decisions about our Q4 strategy and need to move quickly.
    
    CTO Raj Patel: Sarah, I've completed the security audit. We have decided to implement multi-factor authentication across all systems by December 31st.

    Sarah: I'll prepare the presentation by Monday morning. Maria, you should compile the competitive analysis by Friday.
    
    Maria: Perfect. I need to also reach out to our top 10 clients to gauge their reaction to the pricing changes.
    
    CFO David Chen: The Q4 budget review shows we're 15% over on marketing spend. We voted to reallocate $200,000 from events to digital campaigns.
